Algorithm for sum of two numbers-

Input : Two numbers a and b
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare sum to 0  (This is optional step, during step5 we can add declaration and assign directly as well)
Step 3: Read number a
Step 4: Read number b
Step 5: Add a and b and assign result to variable sum
Step 6: Print sum
Step 7: Stop
Output: Sum of a and b

Algorithm for area of circle-

Input : radius of a circle
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read radius 
Step 3: Calculate area, area = 3.14*radius*radius
Step 4: Print area
Step 5: Stop
Output: area

Algorithm for sum of all even number-

1.)Start
2.)Declare a variable of type int i=0,num=n and sum =0
3.)Iteration
for i =0 and i<n
{
sum = sum + i
increment i = i + 2
}
4.)Print Sum
5.)Stop
